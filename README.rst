Python bindings to the Zwift Storage API
===================================================

This is a python client for the Zwift API. There's a Python API (the
``zwiftclient`` module), and a command-line script (``zwift``).

It's based on the original ``swiftclient`` module `available here`__

__ http://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient

This client adds support for ``exec`` command to the client.
For docs see help strings and man page.
